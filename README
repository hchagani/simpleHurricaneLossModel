[INT] Introduction
------------------
This program imvokes a simple mathematical model of financial losses as a
result of landfalling hurricanes in Florida and the Gulf states. The annual
landfalling rates are modelled by Poisson distributions. The probability of
economic loss as a result of landfalling hurricanes are described by LogNormal
distributions.

Model parameters and number of years to simulate are given as command line
arguments. The program outputs run time and mean annual loss after execution.


[REQ] Requirements
------------------
Tested with the Anaconda Python 3.6.8 distribution, with packages:

argparse 1.1
numpy 1.15.1

Executable creation tested with nuitka 0.6.1.1


[IIN] Installation Instructions
-------------------------------
Clone this repository from the command line:

git clone https://github.com/hchagani/simpleHurricaneLossModel

If an executable is desired, the following can be entered on the command line:

python -m nuitka --follow-imports -o gethurricaneloss gethurricaneloss.py

It may be necessary to install nuitka using the following:

pip install nuitka


[UIN] Usage Instructions
------------------------
The program can be run using either the python interpreter or as an executable
after compilation as described above. To print the help message, --help or -h
arguments should be given:


usage: gethurricaneloss [-h] -n N_SAMPLES [-v]
                        florida_landfall_rate florida_mean florida_stddev
                        gulf_landfall_rate gulf_mean gulf_stddev

Estimate mean financial loss per year as a result of landfalling hurricanes in
Florida and the Gulf states.

positional arguments:
  florida_landfall_rate
                        The annual rate of landfalling hurricanes in Florida
  florida_mean          Mean of LogNormal distribution describing economic
                        loss of a landfalling hurricane in Florida
  florida_stddev        Standard deviation of LogNormal distribution
                        describing economic loss of a landfalling hurricane in
                        Florida
  gulf_landfall_rate    The annual rate of landfalling hurricanes in the Gulf
                        states
  gulf_mean             Mean of LogNormal distribution describing economic
                        loss of a landfalling hurricane in the Gulf states
  gulf_stddev           Standard deviation of LogNormal distribution
                        describing economic loss of a landfalling hurricane in
                        the Gulf states

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --verbose         Print mean loss every 100,000 simulation years

required named arguments:
  -n N_SAMPLES, --num_monte_carlo_samples N_SAMPLES
                        Number of samples (i.e. simulation years) to run


Required arguments include the number of samples (i.e. simulation years) which
must be prefixed by the option -n or --num_monte_carlo_samples. Without this
prefix, the program will assume that positional arguments are being entered.
The order of these arguments is important and given in the help message above.
Examples of valid use is as follows:

python gethurricaneloss -n 1000000 2 10000000 50000 4 30000000 100000

or if compiled:

./gethurricaneloss -n 1000000 2 10000000 50000 4 30000000 100000

The above sets the number of simulated years to 1000000, the annual landfall
rates in Florida and the Gulf states to 2 and 4 respectively, and the means
and standard deviations for the LogNormal distributions that describe financial
losses to 10,000,000 and 50,000 respectively in Florida and 30,000,000 and
100,000 respectively in the Gulf states.

An optional -v or --verbose argument can be issued to print out the mean loss
every 100,000 years to check whether the program is still running. This does
slow down execution time however.

Error messages are displayed when invalid arguments are entered, including
negative or zero values. Additionally, the number of samples must be an
integer.
